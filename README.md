// Context: I haven't touched a computer, laptop, tablet or other for well over a decade, and only ever use a mobile device. Thus my opinion on mobile layouts isn't baseless.
// Motivation: Mobile layouts, in my frank opinion, are just bloody horrendous. Whereas Mobile-Desktop layouts are generally adequate enough even despite the absurd auto-zoom crap.
// Concept: The basic idea here, is to override the standard Flarumâ„¢-based website mobile layout and to instead maintain a persistent top navigation bar layout on all view ports.
